            <p>
            The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the bruin, from Middle English. This name originated in the fable History of Reynard the Fox translated by William Caxton from Middle Dutch bruun or bruyn, meaning brown (the color). In the mid-19th century United States, the brown bear was termed "Old Ephraim" and sometimes as "Moccasin Joe".
            
            The scientific name of the brown bear, Ursus arctos, comes from the Latin ursus, meaning "bear", and from ἄρκτος arktos, the Greek word for bear.</p>
